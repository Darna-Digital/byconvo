# codediff.sh

A local git review tool. Review your working tree, compare branches, inspect
commits, and read GitHub pull requests — with inline comments — in a clean,
minimal UI.

![layout](#) <!-- left: file tree · center: diff · bottom: branches & log -->

## Features

- **Working tree review** — see uncommitted changes against `HEAD`
- **Branch compare** — three-dot diff (`base...head`) between any two branches
- **Commit review** — click any commit in the log to see its patch
- **GitHub sync** — list open PRs, read PR diffs, and read/write PR review
  comments (GitLab planned)
- **Inline comments** — click a line number to leave a comment; local comments
  are stored in `.codediff/comments.json` inside the reviewed repo, PR comments
  go to GitHub
- **JetBrains-style git panel** — branches on the left, commit log on the
  right, double-click a branch to check it out
- Light & dark themes, syntax highlighting via Shiki

Built on [`@pierre/trees`](https://trees.software/) for the file tree and
[`@pierre/diffs`](https://diffs.com/) for diff rendering.

## Architecture

```
packages/
  client/   React 19 + Vite + TypeScript UI
  core/     Effect v4 backend — wraps the git CLI and the GitHub REST API,
            serves the HTTP API consumed by the client
```

The core is a small HTTP server (`effect/unstable/http` + `@effect/platform-node`)
exposing `/api/*`; the Vite dev server proxies to it.

## Getting started

```bash
pnpm install

# Point the backend at the repo you want to review (defaults to cwd)
CODEDIFF_REPO=/path/to/your/repo pnpm dev
```

Then open http://localhost:5173.
